#  Hi there! I'm Victoria👋 

I'm a programming student at UTN and currently teach programming and robotics in primary school.  
I have training in AI, machine learning with Arduino, Python and C++.  
I'm passionate about technology and I'm looking for my first job in IT, where I can gain experience and keep learning every day.

I'm still exploring which specific area I enjoy the most, so for now I'm focusing on learning more programming languages and improving the ones I already know.  
I'm especially interested in the QA (Quality Assurance) field.

## 💻 Technologies I use
